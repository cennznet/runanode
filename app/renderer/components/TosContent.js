        <p>THIS TERMS OF
        SERVICE AGREEMENT (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is made between Centrality Limited (&quot;Company&quot;) and any person (&quot;User&quot;) who
        completes the process to <strong>download, utilize, or operate</strong> any software, data processing service,
        application, communication service, or other content created or offered by Company. Company and User are
        collectively referred to as the &quot;Parties.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>BY CLICKING THE ACCEPTANCE BUTTON OR
        ACCESSING, USING OR INSTALLING ANY PART OF THE SOFTWARE, USER EXPRESSLY AGREES TO AND CONSENTS TO BE BOUND BY ALL
        OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF USER DOES NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE USER IS NOT
        AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS, USE OR INSTALL ANY PART OF THE SOFTWARE.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Service Terms and Limitations</h2>
        <p><strong>a. Description.</strong> The Software functions as a free, open source,
        digital cryptocurrency wallet. The Software does not constitute an account by which the Company or any other
        third parties serve as financial intermediaries or custodians of User&apos;s CENNZ or any other cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <p>While the Software has undergone beta testing and continues to be improved by
        feedback from the developers community, open-source contributors and beta-testers, the Company cannot guarantee
        there will not be bugs in the Software. User acknowledges that User&apos;s use of this Software is at User&apos;s risk,
        discretion and in compliance with all applicable laws. User is responsible for safekeeping User&apos;s passwords, PINs,
        private keys, redemption keys, shielded vending keys, backup recovery seed phrases, passcodes and any other codes
        User uses to access the Software or any information, CENNZ, voucher, or other cryptocurrency unit.
        </p>
        <p>IF USER LOSES ACCESS TO USER&apos;S CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET OR PRIVATE KEYS AND HAS NOT
        SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF USER&apos;S CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET OR BACKUP RECOVERY SEED PHRASE(S) AND CORRESPONDING
        PASSWORD(S), USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CENNZ OR ANY OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES USER HAS ASSOCIATED WITH
        THAT CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE. All transaction requests are irreversible. The Company and
        its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, independent contractors, affiliates and agents cannot guarantee
        transaction confirmation or retrieve User&apos;s private keys or passwords if User loses or forgets them.
        </p>
        <p><strong>b. Accessibility.</strong> User agrees that from time to time the Software
        may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, without limitation: (i) equipment malfunctions; (ii)
        periodic maintenance procedures or repairs which Company may undertake from time to time; or (iii) causes beyond
        the control of Company or which are not reasonably foreseeable by Company.

        <p>
          <strong>c. Equipment.</strong> User shall be solely responsible for providing, maintaining and ensuring

        browsers or other equipment, programs and services required to access and use the Software.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Limitations</h2>

        by any person. User agrees to bear all responsibility for the confidentiality of User&apos;s security devices,
        information, keys, or passwords.
        </p>
        <p><strong>b. Privacy.</strong> When reasonably
      practicable, Company will attempt to respect User&apos;s privacy. Company will not monitor, edit, or disclose any
      personal information about User or User&apos;s account, including its contents or User&apos;s use of the Software, without
      User&apos;s prior consent unless Company has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) comply with
      legal process or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (ii) protect and defend the rights or
      property of Company; (iii) enforce this Agreement; (iv) protect the interests of users of the Software other than
      User or any other person; or (v) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of Company&apos;s services or equipment,
      including the Software as authorized by law. User has no expectation of privacy with respect to the Internet
      generally. User&apos;s IP address is transmitted and recorded with each message or other information User sends from
      the Software.
